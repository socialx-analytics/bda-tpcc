In increasingly competitive business conditions, a company will be left behind if it cannot take care of its customers. If that happens, then all efforts will be in vain. In this case, the Company must avoid customer churn. In short, customer churn is the most critical factor that any business should continue to evaluate, especially for a growing business.
